PoseNet Facial Augmentation
This project utilizes the ml5.js library and the PoseNet model to detect facial keypoints and apply facial augmentation to the webcam feed. The code draws keypoints, a skeleton, and adds images (like glasses and smoke) to the detected facial landmarks.

Setup
Prerequisites
p5.js
ml5.js
Getting Started
